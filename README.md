# BLE Traffic Capture and Injection Tool

This Python script allows you to capture BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) traffic, save it to a file, replay the captured traffic, and inject custom BLE packets.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `hcitool`, `btmon`, `gatttool` for basic BLE operations
- A Bluetooth dongle that supports BLE (e.g., CSR 4.0 USB Bluetooth Adapter)

## Installation

1. **Install Python 3.x**:
   - Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.

2. **Install required tools**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install bluez bluez-tools
   
## Usage
Run the script with the desired parameters using the command line:

```bash
python3 ble_proxy.py --interface <interface> --capture-file <capture_file> --capture-duration <capture_duration> --dest-mac <dest_mac> --handle <handle> --value <value>
```
Example
To capture traffic for 60 seconds, save it to ble_capture.log, replay it, and inject a custom packet to destination MAC ```AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF``` with handle ```0x0025``` and value DEADBEEF:

```bash
python3 ble_proxy.py --interface hci0 --capture-file ble_capture.log --capture-duration 60 --dest-mac AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF --handle 0x0025 --value DEADBEEF
Command-Line Arguments
--interface: The Bluetooth interface to use (e.g., hci0).
--capture-file: The file name where the captured traffic will be saved (e.g., ble_capture.log).
--capture-duration: The duration for capturing traffic in seconds (e.g., 60).
--dest-mac: The destination MAC address for the custom packet (e.g., AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF).
--handle: The handle of the characteristic to write to (e.g., 0x0025).
--value: The value to write (in hex, e.g., DEADBEEF).
```
